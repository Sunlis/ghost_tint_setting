### Ghost Tint Settings

On startup, read user settings and override relevant constants that (partially?) control ghost entity display. Default ghost tint values can be found [here](https://github.com/wube/factorio-data/blob/master/core/prototypes/utility-constants.lua) (look for "ghost_tint" and "ghost_shimmer").

I tried a few variants, but didn't manage to get any reasonable readability back.

Examples:
